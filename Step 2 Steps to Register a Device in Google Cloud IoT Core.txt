Steps to Register a Device in Google Cloud IoT Core:

To connect your IoT device (like an Arduino Uno with an ESP8266) to Google Cloud IoT Core, you need to register the device in Google Cloud IoT Core

Set Up Google Cloud IoT Core:

	Ensure you have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
	Create a new project or use an existing one.
	
Enable IoT Core API:

	In the GCP Console, go to the APIs & Services dashboard.
	Enable the IoT Core API for your project.

Create an IoT Core Registry:

	In the GCP Console, navigate to IoT Core.
	Click Create a registry.
	Fill in the details such as registry ID, region, and choose a default telemetry topic.
	
Register a Device:

	Inside your IoT Core registry, go to the Devices tab.
	Click Create a device.
	Fill in the device ID (this is your womensafty-device_id).
	Configure the device authentication using public/private key pairs.
	Optionally, configure other device settings.
	
Retrieve Device ID:

	After creating the device, you'll see it listed under the Devices tab of your registry.
	The device_id is the ID you provided during device registration.
